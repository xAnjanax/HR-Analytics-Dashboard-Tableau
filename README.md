# HR-Analytics-Dashboard - Tableau 

Given a dataset with employee information, we create a dynamic dashboard in evaluating metrics that allow us to understand why there has been an increase in employee turnover (churn). 

### Main factors explored in this project include: 
- Overview of metrics including Employee Count, Attrition Count (accounting for "Yes" values), Attrition Rate, Active Employees, Average Age. 
- Attrition analyzed in relation with Departments, Education Fields, Age Groups, Gender. 
- Job satisfaction rating across different Job Roles listed in the dataset.
- Putting it all together, with the addition of a dropdown menu that enables filtering based on other attributes in the dataset.
